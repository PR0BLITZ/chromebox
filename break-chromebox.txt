Turn OS Verification Off -------------- + + +
========================
- Power off machine 
- Hold recovery button 
  (Requires a bent paperclip to press and hold down) 
- CTRL + D   (Developer mode) 
- ESC?     (You'll hear beeps, loud) 
- Reboot
- CTRL + L   ( 2 beeps, loud)
- Hold CTRL + ALT + F2 (Wait until after 2 beeps/until "ChromeOS" screen appears) 

You should see a console. 
Note: scrolling is not available (as far as I know, yet) on the console screen; however, the arrow keys U/D/L/R work for navigation

login = chronos (Be quick!) 
(optional, informational) uname -a
(optional, informational) ip a
sudo initctl stop powerd (Instructions available on dev screen 
sudo su -  (Passwordless root auth) 
crossystem dev_boot_altfw=1  (This enables the Legasy Boot Mode / Alternative Bootloader (AltFw) and will provide a method to allow alternate OS booting. Exciting!) 

==================================================
Disable Write-Protection -------------- + + +
========================
First, determine which of the following devices matches yours: https://docs.mrchromebox.tech/docs/supported-devices.html ... I have an ASUS Chromebox 3, so I have two methods of hardware modification: CR50 (SuzyQ), or "screw" ... 
Second, remove the screw from the Chromebox. 
See the "images" folder in this repo. Also see: https://docs.mrchromebox.tech/images/wp/fizz_wp.jpg 
I put the screw on the side of the box so it wouldn't get lost -- You can dispose of it if you wish. 

===================================================
Alternate OS Configuration -------------- + + +
==========================
Source: https://docs.mrchromebox.tech/docs/fwscript.html
Goal: dual-boot Chromebox with ChromeOS and Arch Linux (let's hope this thing can handle it!) 
------------------------------------------------------------------
exit (Leave root escalation)
ensure you are at ~ (It's the default when exiting root, but just in case, "cd ~ ")
curl -LO mrchromebox.tech/firmware-util.sh && sudo bash firmware-util.sh
Choose "Install/Update RW_LEGACY Firmware" 
Select 'L' for Legacy BIOS 
N for leaving as CTRL + L requirement (for now) 
Ensure the security screw is removed
'R' for reboot
CTRL + L 

==========================
DISREGARD THIS SECTION ---- I took a 7 month break. 
==========================
Ensure your keyboard (a wired keyboard will likely work, because for me, a wireless keyboard did not) and mouse (might be able to be wireless, since I can use a wireless mouse) and bootable USB drive are plugged into the Chrome box. 
When powering on the machine, click and hold [ESC]. You should see a white screen with a warning: "OS verification is OFF" 
Ignore that warning, and hold [ESC] while waiting. You will hear 2 beeps and eventually see a black screen. This will help you choose your boot device. Thank you Mr. Chromebox! 
You should then, after clicking [ESC] again to get to the boot options, see the bootable USB. Click the number corresponding to it. For me, it was [2]. 
Next, you will see a white screen with "Ventoy" written on it. This is where you can select the OS image to boot. I'm trying Arch and hoping it goes well. 
You can click some of the F keys for other options to look at, but I didn't quite successfully return to previous pages, so I had to reboot a lot. 
Select your OS of choice, and congrats you did it!

==========================
I actually bricked the thing. The "neverending loop" I was stuck in once was consistently getting stuck on the "OS verification is OFF" and then a black boot-item screen. Which is where I techncially am stuck right now. My goal is to wipe ChromeOS entirely, and the way to get there was through Mr. Chromebox's firmware program, which I somehow lost?

Interesting notes: 
- Chromeboxes store their Ethernet MAC address in the RO_VPD (read-only vital product data) region of the stock firmware. 
- neofetch for Arch ASCII

Accidents and Fixes: 
Somewhere in section 3, I ran the firmware-util.sh script and changed the boot order to "boot menu for 30 seconds" which got me stuck in a neverending loop of some kind (this happened 7 months ago and I never finished my sentence).
