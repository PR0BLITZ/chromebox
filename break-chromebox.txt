Turn OS Verification Off -------------- + + +
========================
- Power off machine 
- Hold recovery button 
  (Requires a bent paperclip to press and hold down) 
- CTRL + D   (Developer mode) 
- ESC?     (You'll hear beeps, loud) 
- Reboot
- CTRL + L   ( 2 beeps, loud)
- Hold CTRL + ALT + F2 (Wait until after 2 beeps/until "ChromeOS" screen appears) 

You should see a console. 
Note: scrolling is not available (as far as I know, yet) on the console screen; however, the arrow keys U/D/L/R work for navigation

login = chronos (Be quick!) 
(optional, informational) uname -a

sudo initctl stop powerd (Instructions available on dev screen 
sudo su -  (Passwordless root auth) 
crossystem dev_boot_altfw=1  (This enables the Legasy Boot Mode / Alternative Bootloader (AltFw) and will provide a method to allow alternate OS booting. Exciting!)

Disable Write-Protection -------------- + + +
========================
First, determine which of the following devices matches yours: https://docs.mrchromebox.tech/docs/supported-devices.html ... I have an ASUS Chromebox 3, so I have two methods of hardware modification: CR50 (SuzyQ), or "screw" ... 
Second, remove the screw from the Chromebox. 
See the "images" folder in this repo. Also see: https://docs.mrchromebox.tech/images/wp/fizz_wp.jpg 
I put the screw on the side of the box so it wouldn't get lost -- You can dispose of it if you wish.

Alternate OS Configuration -------------- + + +
==========================

Goal: dual-boot Chromebox with ChromeOS and Arch Linux (let's hope this thing can handle it!) 
------------------------------------------------------------------
exit (Leave root escalation)
ensure you are at ~ (It's the default when exiting root, but just in case, "cd ~ ")
curl -LO mrchromebox.tech/firmware-util.sh && sudo bash firmware-util.sh
Choose "Install/Update RW_LEGACY Firmware" 
Select 'L' for Legacy BIOS 
N for leaving as CTRL + L requirement (for now) 
Ensure the security screw is removed
'R' for reboot
CTRL + L 





Interesting notes: 
- Chromeboxes store their Ethernet MAC address in the RO_VPD (read-only vital product data) region of the stock firmware. 
- neofetch for Arch ASCII

Accidents and Fixes: 
Somewhere in section 3, I ran the firmware-util.sh script and changed the boot order to "boot menu for 30 seconds" which got me stuck in a neverending loop of
